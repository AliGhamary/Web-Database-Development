# Web Database Development with MySQL, PyMySQL and Python

This is a Python CGI web application project using an SQL database containing tables of swimmers and swimming events. 

The webpage initially displays information about all events in the database categorized by event titles.

The application accepts an HTTP parameter "eid" which filters events by their Id number and displays the swimmers in that particular event as well as related information.
