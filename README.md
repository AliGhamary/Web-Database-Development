# Web Database Development with MySQL, PyMySQL and Python

This is a Python CGI web application project using an SQL database containing tables of swimmers and swimming events. 

The webpage initially displays information about the different kinds of events in the database categorized by event titles and the location of the event. The webpage also displays the number of times an event has taken place at each location. 

The application accepts an HTTP parameter "eid" which filters events by their Id number and displays the swimmers in that particular event as well as related information.
